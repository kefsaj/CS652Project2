## For this assignment it involves designing and implementing a Fat-Tree topology and its routing protocol using Mininet and Ryu. This assignment is consist of two main parts.

## Mininet
In the first part, a Fat-Tree topology implemented using Mininet API. The detailed description can be found in Section 1 of the assignment above.  File named Part1.py is involved in this session.

## Routing using Ryu Controller
In the second part,  an Fat-Tree routing scheme is designed, and then  the routing scheme implemented using the Ryu API. The detailed description (Java is replace with Python and FloodLight with Ryu) is in the assignment 2 above. Files named part2.py and part3.py are involved in this session.

part3.py is used from Ehsan70 :
